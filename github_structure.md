# GitHub Repository File Structure

When you create your GitHub repo, organize it like this:

```

├── README.md                            # User instructions
├── LICENSE                              # MIT or your choice
│
└── templates/
    ├── job_monitor_template.py          # Main monitoring script template
    └── job_test_template.py             # Health check script template
```
